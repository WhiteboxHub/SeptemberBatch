Selenium





Automation: Testing the given application (web or mobile) using the external tools or the automation framework code.

Selenium is used to automate the web application.

Advantages of Automation:

Repeatability of the tests using tools or codes rather than manual testing leads to increase the speed of execution of test cases.

Sprint1 -100TC

Sprint 2-100TC+100TC

for cross browser testing, compatibility, parallel testing, different platforms

We can vary the tests for different user easily by implementing data driven testing.

Login scenario - 20 sets (positive. negative)—different different i/p

It easily supports frequent regression testing do be done in minimal time and generates good test reports to analyze.

It also helps to find the defects which may miss while doing manual testing.

- Advantages of automation

Human tendency to miss something—automation

Test coverage is good

Fast

Regression testing

Data driven testing.

- Limitations of automation testing.

Shorter time limits—

Looks and feel—UI Testing—video and audio quality-

Captcha images,opt generations

Dev-

In the test environment we can make it constant

Call to captcha service

Java code

Web/browser application.

UI of the page is frequently change

Login page:--


Manually –Open, enter un, pwd, click ok.


Automation-opens the browser, find the textbox  to enter un, pwd, button, asserting for next step.


When to automate and when to not automate ?

Automation depends on timebrame available, if we have very tight dead line then we cannot go for automation.

Automation should be avoided if there is any UI change expected in near future as we need to rewrite the automations script again.

Also application scenario wise-pages which need manual interaction cannot be automated like

- If there is some captcha code being generated instantly and you need to enter that code or payment page whether OTP is being sent to mobile.
- Image/video Previews- Between transitioning between thumbnail and playback of video I have observed not well automated.
- Barcode Reader cannot be automated.

- Few look and feel related test cases need manual testing

Different Automation tools & frameworks: Selenium. QTP-vbscript, SilkTest etc.
Selenium is set of different tools support different test approaches..

In 2004- Jason Huggins started Selenium at Thoughtworks.
Initially he developed a javascript library

What is selenium—
Selenium webdriver(API) is a tool used to automate web application
Webdriver-it is an interface from selenium webdriver api,
Which is used to automate web applications.
Web Elements –
Components:
IDE, RC, Grid, web driver
IDE- plugin for firefox, record and playback tool, assert statements.

Selenium IDE- is a tool which generates automation scripts. It’s plugin/add only in Mozilla browser.
Create automation scripts quickly, to learn automation scripts with the help of a tool aided mechanism.
Also as a beginner who move from manual testing to automation- he can have a glance of automation scripts using the selenium IDE.

He can also get an idea about locators.
Selenium 1- programmatic way of automation which had been now developed as webdriver.

Selenium RC- Selenium Remote Control- Client server Architecture.
Its currently deprecated.

Testcase:
Testcase
Execute it – result
Assert(actual,expected)-
Actual-result
Expected –specification doc.

Assert/ verify:-
Assert(act,exp)- True- passed –it continues with the execution
False- failed- it comes out of the method, it is not going to continue with the rest of the steps.


Verify(act,exp)- true – passed – it continues with the execution
False- logs the error and continues the next steps in the same method.


Limitation of IDE:-
Record Options – limited options, cannot enchance the code according to the requirement only works for firefox
We cannot integrate with other tools

Selenium WebDriver : it is an API written to automate scripts.
There is an interface named WebDriver which enables us to interact with the browser. Every browser have their own Driver class implemented.

http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/index.html

How to create automation test script :

- Create WebDriver Object we need to first load the browser.
- to load the browser set the property and path of the browser executable.
- Load the given URL in the browser
- Find the webelement required for action
-  Perform the action
- get actual result from the action
- get expected result BRD/SRS in agile defined in user story
- compare the actual and expected
- report test case pass or fail.

EXAMPLE:-
public class Firstexample{

public static void main(String arg[]){

System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","C:\\Users\\WBL\\MedhaWorkspace\\Web\\resources\\drivers\\chromedriver.exe");
driver =new ChromeDriver();
driver.get(https://www.walmart.com/);
System.out.println(“Title:” +driver.getTitle());
}}

@Test()
public void loginTest() {


System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","C:\\Users\\WBL\\MedhaWorkspace\\Web\\resources\\drivers\\chromedriver.exe");
driver =new ChromeDriver();
driver.get(https://www.walmart.com/);

}
