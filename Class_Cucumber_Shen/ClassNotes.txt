Cucumber

BDD
Behavior driven development

Web based development
every page had a class and test class

Based on the behavior of the user story
the development is taken care

in BRD
User should be able to locate store nearby // find the nearest store

Test Driven Development
BDD is built upon TDD

the user story  as a feature
for one feature different scenarios are written

In BDD, you can directly involve the client and non-technical people
in the team to understand the flow of requirement.

Cucumber has 3 main components

1.Feature file  with extension .feature  (Gherkin language)
  Feature: User should find the nearest location
  
  Scenario: User enters zipcode and press enter
  Given: User access homepage walmart.components
  When: User enters zipcode
  then: User visits location page
  
  Scenario: User enters cityname and press enter
  Given: User access homepage walmart.components
  When: User enters city
  And:
  then:
  then: User visits location page
  
  Cucumber recommends one scenario to be within 5 to 6 steps
  if it is more than 5 then subdivide it into multiple scenario
  break the scenario into sub scenarios
  
  
  
  it is in plain English----Gherkin where it follows certain keywords
  run as cucumber feature to get the skeleton
 
2. StepDefinition Class

   the class written for the feature file
   the scenarios are described as methods
    given  --->  homepage
	when --> condition executed
	then ---> assertions will be done here.


3.  Runner Class

   Will actually map the feature file with the stepdefinition file.
   
   Cucumber defined annotations
   @RunWith
   @CucumberOption(features ={path of the feature file},
                   glue ={path of stepdefinition file},
					dryRun
					strict)

					
What is the advantage of cucumber
plain text, client can also be involved
maps require to automation in a easy way

What are the files needed for cucumber

What is the language used in feature file

What are the types of tests you can run with
  Selenium cucumber
  
  Web based
  API

  
  Install cucumber into Eclipse
  using https://cucumber.io/cucumber-eclipse/
  
  https://cucumber.io/cucumber-eclipse/update-site
  in Help install new software
  
  
  Add the maven project
  
  dependencies needed for cucumber
  Cucumber-java
  Cucumber-junit
  Cucumber-picocontainer
  
  
  For one scenario send multiple data
  DataTable
  get Table using the featurefile
  
  
  
  
  
  Same Scenario but different conditions
  Scenario Example
  Scenario Outline:
  
  
  
  
  Example:
  
  |   |   |
  
  CucumberOptions- 
  feature, glue(step definitions),
  dryRun,strict, monochrome
  
  dryRun = true / false
  true --- tells the runner class to check for 
            feature and step definitions
			it will not execute the test scripts
  false -- the actual execution of test script is done
  
  
  
  monochrome
  This option can either set as true or false.
  If it is set as true, it means that the console output 
  for the Cucumber test are much more readable. 
  
  Strict mode
Using the -- strict flag will cause cucumber to fail 
unless all the step definitions have been defined.
  
  Gherkin language
  regular expressions
  snippets - skeleton generated by the feature file 
              which is to be used in stepdefinition
  
  
  docstrings
  """
   the user tries to login with
   multiple values <username>
  """
  
  https://cucumber.io/docs/reference
  If you need to specify information in a scenario that won't fit on a single line, 
you can use a DocString.

A DocString follows a step, and starts and ends with three double quotes, like this:

When I ask to reset my password
Then I should receive an email with:
  """
  Dear bozo,

  Please click this link to reset your password
  """
  
  
  
  regular expressions
  snippets
  
  
  Cucumber step definitions
  @before , @after
  @before - will be executed before scenario in feature file
        you can have multiple before annotations
		 @Before(order=0)@Before(order=1)
		 order is incremental
  
  @after - will be executed after scenario in feature file
          you can have multiple after annotations 
         @After(order=1)@After(order=0)	
			order is decremental
		 
  
  before after order priority
  before with tag name  @Before(“@First”)   @Before("@First,@Third")
  @Before(order=0)@Before(order=1)
  @After(order=1)@After(order=0)
  
  
  
  tags ---> and or 
  >>Tags which are comma separated are ORed. 
    tags ={"@first,@second"}
  >>Tags which are passed in separate quotes are ANDed
     tags ={"@first","@second"}
	  ie
	  @first @second
	  scenario --- two annotations given
  >>Special Character ~ is used to skip the tags.  
	  
  
  Cucumber DataDriven in featurefile
  
  DataTable  - it is used to test same scenario 
                with multiple data
				DataTable is passed as argument to the method
  |data1|  List
  |data2|
  
  |row1col1|row1col2|  Map
  |row2col1|row2col2|
  |row3col1|row3col2|
  
  -----------
  
  scenario outline:  it is used for 
                      multiple scenarios
					  
					   String is passed as argument to the method
    when "<data1>"
  
  
  Example:
  |requirement1|requirement2|
  |row1col1|row1col2|
  |row2col1|row2col2|
  |row3col1|row3col2|
