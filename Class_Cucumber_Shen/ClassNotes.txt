Cucumber

BDD
Behavior driven development

Web based development
every page had a class and test class

Based on the behavior of the user story
the development is taken care

in BRD
User should be able to locate store nearby // find the nearest store

Test Driven Development
BDD is built upon TDD

the user story  as a feature
for one feature different scenarios are written

In BDD, you can directly involve the client and non-technical people
in the team to understand the flow of requirement.

Cucumber has 3 main components

1.Feature file  with extension .feature  (Gherkin language)
  Feature: User should find the nearest location
  
  Scenario: User enters zipcode and press enter
  Given: User access homepage walmart.components
  When: User enters zipcode
  then: User visits location page
  
  Scenario: User enters cityname and press enter
  Given: User access homepage walmart.components
  When: User enters city
  And:
  then:
  then: User visits location page
  
  Cucumber recommends one scenario to be within 5 to 6 steps
  if it is more than 5 then subdivide it into multiple scenario
  break the scenario into sub scenarios
  
  
  
  it is in plain English----Gherkin where it follows certain keywords
  run as cucumber feature to get the skeleton
 
2. StepDefinition Class

   the class written for the feature file
   the scenarios are described as methods
    given  --->  homepage
	when --> condition executed
	then ---> assertions will be done here.


3.  Runner Class

   Will actually map the feature file with the stepdefinition file.
   
   Cucumber defined annotations
   @RunWith
   @CucumberOption(features ={path of the feature file},
                   glue ={path of stepdefinition file},
					dryRun
					strict)

					
What is the advantage of cucumber
plain text, client can also be involved
maps require to automation in a easy way
